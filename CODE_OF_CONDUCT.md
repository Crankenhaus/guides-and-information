# Contributor/Member Code of Conduct

As contributors/members of the Crankenhaus projects, we pledge to respect everyone who
contributes in any way, be it pull requests, creating issues, commenting or
updating documentation et cetera.

When you communicate with anyone in the project, you should follow Wheaton's law.
We are a free software family, and we value honesty and respect.

We do not care about race, gender, religion, age or level of experience, or
anything else. The only thing we care about is your willingness to learn and to
contribute. Everyone contributing to the projects is expected to do the same.

So, if you see anyone violating the code of conduct, report it to one of the project leads,
but don't just report someone because they critized your work. 
If the code of conduct is violated we will take action against that individual.

The code of conduct is meant to create a safe and welcoming environment for
everyone.
