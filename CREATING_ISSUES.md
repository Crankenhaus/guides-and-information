# Creating Issues

## The Title

The title of an issue should contain a minimal description of the problem, and
the fitting prefix, nothing else.   
A prefix tells us where the problem exists, for example:

* CORE
* DOCS
* FEATURE
* PLUGIN 

## The Content

The content should be as detailed as possible.
A few things to note:

* What happened?
* Why did it happen?
* Can you recreate the problem?
* What was your running environment?
* Screenshots (if applicable)


Now, if you already have a fix, open a MR at the same time and link it to 
the Issue you created. But that isn't needed.

## Don't be scared

Don't be scared to open an issue. We **will** be happy about any information
and feedback we can get, even if you might think the problem is silly.
